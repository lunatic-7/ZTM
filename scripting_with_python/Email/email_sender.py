# The Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is an internet standard communication protocol for electronic mail
# transmission. Mail servers and other message transfer agents use SMTP to send and receive mail messages. User-level
# email clients typically use SMTP only for sending messages to a mail server for relaying, and typically submit
# outgoing email to the mail server on port 587 or 465 per RFC 8314. For retrieving messages, IMAP (which replaced
# the older POP3) is standard, but proprietary servers also often implement proprietary protocols, e.g.,
# Exchange ActiveSync.

# Since SMTP's introduction in 1981, it has been updated, modified and extended multiple times. The protocol version
# in common use today has extensible structure with various extensions for authentication, encryption, binary data
# transfer, and internationalized email addresses. SMTP servers commonly use the Transmission Control Protocol on
# port number 25 (for plaintext) and 587 (for encrypted communications).
