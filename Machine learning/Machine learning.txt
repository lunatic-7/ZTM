What is machine learning!?

It is training a machine, or giving it an ability to perform a function, just like humans.

REMEMBER ---> How we created functions for a desired output by giving a specific input. But 

In machine learning, Machine creates the functions based on the input and output.

What machine learning Expert do?

1 --> Import the Data

2 --> Clear the Data

3 --> Split Data into Training Set/Test Set

4 --> Create a model

5 --> Check the output

6 --> Improve

7 --> Repeat the process if needed.

# Libraries we are gonna use!

1 ---> NumPy = It's a library that helps us to use lists and arrays in Python. Specifally multi-dimensional arrays which are used more
often in Machine learning.

2 ---> pandas = pandas is used for what we call Data Analysis.

3 ---> scikit-learn = scikit-learn is used in creating the model part.

4 ---> matplotlib = Also, called a charting library, It allows us to visualize data in a very nice way.

5 ---> jupyter notebook = Finally, we need jupyter notebook. It is really helpful when we do machine learning and 
data science.

6 ---> Kaggle = Kaggle is a community of machine learning experts, we can do a lot of stuffs here, such a see other people's
notebook, part in competitions, and the best part we are gonna do is to get data from here, as we aren't facebook and
amazon. We don't have any source of data, but kaggle provides us a lot of data to work upon.
