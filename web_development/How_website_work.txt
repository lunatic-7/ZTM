How website works?

There are two main things when talking of website, 1st Browser and 2nd a Server.

We type something in a browser, it could be any browser like google, yahoo, safari etc.

And then that browser whatever we type sends to a server, asking for data.

Using http/https protocol. If server permits, and gives the data, Browser shows it to us.

That server can be located anywhere in the world, It doesn't matter.

A server side contain, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML is body of website, CSS is styling

and JavaScript give logic to website, And the sever which is the main thing, can be written

in any language such as Python, Java, PHPP etc., We are gonna write server in Python

in this course, obviously bc it is Python's course.
