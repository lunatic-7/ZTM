# What is a Google Bot, Bing Bot etc.?

A Google bot or bing bot scrapes data from websites to index them or,
rank them on google web page, eg. If we ask for poems, them google
checks all the websites and indexes them by looking at the key word 'poems',
in each website. So, it means websites allow google to scrape data, for their
good, but there are some info. which they don't want to be extracted, we can see that with/robots.txt
as mentioned earlier. If a website don't show anything in robots.txt, it means they don't care google
or anyone can extract any of their data.
